# Gellix Font Files

To complete the Gellix font setup, please add the following font files to this directory:

## Required Files:

- `Gellix-Regular.woff2` and `Gellix-Regular.woff` (weight: 400)
- `Gellix-Medium.woff2` and `Gellix-Medium.woff` (weight: 500)
- `Gellix-SemiBold.woff2` and `Gellix-SemiBold.woff` (weight: 600)
- `Gellix-Bold.woff2` and `Gellix-Bold.woff` (weight: 700)

## Where to get Gellix:

Gellix is a commercial font. You can purchase it from:
- MyFonts: https://www.myfonts.com/collections/gellix-font-lettertype
- Fontspring: https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/type-dynamic/gellix

## Alternative:

If you don't have access to Gellix, the site will fall back to Arial and then system sans-serif fonts, which still look good with the current typography settings.

## Format Conversion:

If you have TTF or OTF files, you can convert them to WOFF/WOFF2 using:
- https://cloudconvert.com/woff-converter
- https://transfonter.org/
